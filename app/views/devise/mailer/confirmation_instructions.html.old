<p><strong> Now ideally, we should all get together to welcome each other to <strong>DiEM25! </strong></p>

<p>Alas, Europe is too large to allow this!</p>

<p>Europe may be very large but it is not powerful enough to withstand the destructive forces that are tearing the EU apart.</p>

<p>The reason? With their incompetence and authoritarianism, the EU establishment have turned Europeans against it.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think of the EU, its disintegration today threatens the peoples of Europe with a (post)modern 
version of the 1930s.</p>

<p>To resist these forces threatening Europe’s weakest citizens, its culture of tolerance, and its basic humanism, 
the European Union must be democratised.</p>

<p>Nothing else will do!</p>

<p>We formed DiEM25 to create a movement to reverse Europe’s disintegration. With you, and each one of us, as its 
principal agent. Together we stand a chance. Divided we shall surely fall.</p>

<p>We have much work to do. The first step was completed when you joined DiEM. You will now get regular updates 
whenever DiEM25 is planning another step and you will be able to contribute to DiEM's success. We also recommend 
you check out the <a href="http://www.diem25.org/forum">Forum</a> (note this requires a separate sign-up).</p>

<p><strong>Carpe DiEM25!</strong></p>
