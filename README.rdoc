Develop in git, push to Heroku, very simple.

=== To start coding

Ensure you have:

* Ruby 2.3.3
* Rails 5.1

Then:

* Define DB user in ENV, as described in database.yml
* Change application.yml.sample to application.yml (provide real values)
* Ensure application.yml NEVER gets committed!
* bundle install
* rake db:migrate
* create initial user
* That's probably it!

=== To test

* rspec
* cucumber
